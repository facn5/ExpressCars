# ExpressCars

Express server-rendered full-stack - Find the right car for you!

### What
User fills a form of desired specifications/features/capabilities to find the matching car for the user.
After retreving 3 cars that matches his needs, the user can read more details about these cars.

### What Technically?
* An app using the Express framework.
* Using a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
* Using the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for server-side
* rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

### Why?
The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up an Express server and to discover the awesomeness of Handlebars! Spend time considering how to format your layouts, partials and helper functions.

### Goals:-
- [ ] Include tests and set up code coverage.
- [ ] We expect to see unit tests of pure functions, and integration tests of your server routes, including tests for errors such as 404, 500.
- [ ] You should write tests for your database and use a separate test database and build script.
- [ ] Use Heroku or a similar service to host the app and the database.
- [ ] Try to include ES6 syntax on the server.
