# FullstackExpress

Express server-rendered full-stack app

### What?
* An app using the Express framework.
* Using a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
* Using the retrieved data to populate a Handlebars template for server-side 
* rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

### Why?
The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up an Express server and to discover the awesomeness of Handlebars! Spend time considering how to format your layouts, partials and helper functions.
